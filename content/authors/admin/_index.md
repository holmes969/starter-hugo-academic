I am a research scientist at [Meta (formally known as Facebook) Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of California Irvine in 2022, advised by Prof. [Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/). During my Ph.D. studies, I was awarded the [2021 Facebook Fellowship](https://research.fb.com/fellows/zhang-cheng//). Before that, I obtained my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from BJUT (2011-2015) and my M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University (2015-2017).

My research focuses on physics-based rendering and its inverse problems (i.e., analysis by synthesis) centered around the inference of geometric and material properties from physical measurements (e.g., photographs, depth data). To develop a general solution to various inverse rendering problems, I have been working actively on the topic of physics-based differentiable rendering.
